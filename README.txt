task1 
    task1 is for neutral vs expression facial classification on DATA.mat 
    
    Choose a value for 'test_ratio'
    Set 'MDA' to false to project with PCA and set to true to project with MDA 
    Set 'KNN' to flase to use Bayes' Classifier and true to use K-NN rule
    Choose value for 'L' which will impact the PCA projection 
    Choose value for 'K' which will impact the K-NN rule 

    Choose number of trials to run automatically with 'numTrials', each trial will 
    have indpendent random test/training data and all intermediate values 

    run

task2 
    task1 is for subject classification

    Instead of test ratio choose trainingImagesPerSubject, for illumination the default is 17
    out of 21
    Set 'MDA' to false to project with PCA and set to true to project with MDA 
    Set 'KNN' to flase to use Bayes' Classifier and true to use K-NN rule
    Choose value for 'L' which will impact MDA and PCA projection 
    Choose value for 'K' which will impact the K-NN rule 

    Choose number of trials to run automatically with 'numTrials', each trial will 
    have indpendent random test/training data and all intermediate values 

    run
